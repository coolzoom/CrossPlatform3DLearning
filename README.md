Notice for Everyone Following the Cross-Platform 3D Learning Project
====================================================================

I started this project more than a year ago, as a beginner game developer, in an effort to do what a beginner game developer, especially a hobbyist, is not advised to do: Build all the core elements of my first 3D game from the ground up, without using a ready-made feature-rich library or game engine. I have already discussed my motivation for this in my article on GDNet (http://goo.gl/cXdh36) and have kept a record of my progress on my blog (http://goo.gl/ww8pzg).

As I have mentioned in the eleventh blog entry (http://goo.gl/nCfgvJ), the game is now playable and, by the time I write the twelfth entry, this project will have been completed, with sound, bells and whistles and all. I have always thought that, after that, I should probably take everything I have learned and join a large established open-source game engine project, in order to be more productive on the gameplay front.

I have recently decided however, that I will not be doing that. I have gone through the code and separated what can be considered to be a game engine (which is most of it) from what is the actual game. Even though it is still in its infancy, the engine is now functional and is called small3d. It is meant for people who, like myself, want to be as productive as possible in game development, while controlling and understanding the low level details at the same time. The game itself is packaged as a sample use case, together with the engine. You can find it all in my block on biicode:

I have chosen to use biicode (http://www.biicode.com/) because this way, in my humble opinion:

- I can always reuse my components without going through lengthy setup procedures.
- I can compile release binaries without re-downloading all the libraries I am using.
- I can incorporate code into my project that other developers have written, simply by referencing their header files via my include statements.
- I can make my code available for others to use, in the same easy manner.
- I can get a lot of help in making my engine support even more platforms.

By the way, this is not a publicity campaign for biicode. I am just explaining my reasons for placing this project there.

If you are interested in this project but never had the time to set it up, I am sure that you will be pleasantly surprised at how easily you can do that with its new format (http://goo.gl/ERGf8v). As always, there is a GitHub repository which I would like to invite you to follow, just like you have followed CrossPlatform3DLearning:

https://github.com/dimitrikourk/small3d

CrossPlatform3DLearning will always be available here, for those who have forked or would like to refer to it. But I will be focusing on small3d now.
