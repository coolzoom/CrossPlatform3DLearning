Cross-Platform 3D Learning
---------

This is a game I am making, in order to learn how to develop
3D games in C++, using OpenGL, and hopefully provide a working
code base for others to do the same.

For an introduction, please refer to the article I have posted on GDNet:

I also blog on the progress, about once per month:
